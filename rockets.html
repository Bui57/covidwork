    <p style= "color: #ff0050; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20" >Chemcial rockets have an isp of 450 seconds and a delta-v of 4km per sec and use liquid hydrogen or some other combustional fuel to shoot propellant
      out of the back. They can give a lot of thrust in a short period of time, perfect for taking off but are extremely inefficient</p>

    <p style= "color: #ff0050; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20">Nuclear thermal rockets have a twice as fast exhaust velocity(10000 m per sec), twice
      as much delta-v (9.8 km per sec) and have an Isp of 100. Although they are actually less hot as chemical engines, they can utilise the heat energy more effectively so are
      much more faster than chemical rockets.</p>

    <img src= "z.jpg" style= "width: 300px">
    <p style= "color: #ff0050; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20">Ion engines ionise gas, and then shoot the ions out of the back at 90km/sec. they
      accelerate slowly but have a high final speed. To accelerate faster, we heat the gas to plasma temperatures and accelerate it with a
      magnetic field. The system is called the VASMIR and could get us to mars in 39 days.</p>

    <img src= "k.jpg" style= "wisth: 300px">
    <p style= "color: #ff0050; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20">The fusion rocket is powered by duterium fusion. It would have an exhaust velocity
      of 10000km per second and an top speed of 0.071c. It uses neutron beams to ignite fuel pellets which it shoots out of the back using its magnetic nozzle.
      Because of the heat generated by the fusion blast, it needs to be very durable.</p>
